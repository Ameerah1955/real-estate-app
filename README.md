Build a Frontend for a Real Estate Listing Management Application using React

Objective: Develop a React application that interfaces with the Real Estate Property Management API. This application should enable users to browse, view, add, edit, and delete property listings through a user-friendly interface

Technology Stack:
React: (latest stable version)
API: You can use (https://mockapi.io/) as your backend.
CSS Framework: Your choice (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind, Material-UI) for styling 
Library: Axios  API for HTTP requests.

1. Project Setup:
- Create a new React application using Create React App.
- Set up Axios or Fetch for making API calls to the backend.

2. Property Listings Page:
- Develop a component to display a list of all properties fetched from the API.
- Include a brief overview of each property, such as the title, address, price, and a
thumbnail image if available.

3. Property Detail Page:
- Implement a detailed view for individual properties. When a user clicks on a
listing, they should be taken to this page where more detailed information is
displayed.

4. Add/Edit Property Form:
- Create a form component that can be used both for adding new properties and
editing existing ones.
- Utilize React's form handling capabilities and implement validation feedback for
the user.

5. Delete Property:
- Provide a way for users to delete properties, with a confirmation prompt to
prevent accidental deletions.

6. Navigation:
â—‹ Implement a navigation bar to easily move between the list of properties and the
form to add a new property.

7. Responsive Design:
- Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on a range of devices.
